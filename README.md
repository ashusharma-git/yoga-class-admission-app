## About the application and its design
Home page of this web app serves the form to submit in order to join yoga-session.

There are three tables in one database, namely- applicant, batch, payment.

Once the form is submitted, applicant's details is populated in `applicant table` followed by `batch table` which stores in which batch a particular candidate is enrolled in.

Batch table has an entity named `has_changed` which has value either `0` or `1`. `0` means applicant has not changed their batch time in the current month, therefore that applicant is eligible to change their batch shift. If applicant request to change their time then first it checks in table, if `has_changed` column is `1` then she/he is not eligible to change their time in that particular, though he/she can change it in next month. When applicant changes their batch, value for `has_changed` column is changed to `1`.

Relationship Cardinality between `Applicant` and `Batch` is `Mandatory One`, since each applicant can be enrolled in only one batch.

Relationship Cardinality between `Applicant` and `Payment` is `Optionally Many`, since each applicant needs to pay fees every month in order to continue attending classes. Though applicant may choose not to continue in any particular month.

As of now, when applicant submit the admission form `makePayment()` function is there which can be later implemented to make actual payment; currently this only inserts payment details with randomly generated transaction id.

There is a monthly cronjob which runs at `00:00 am` on first day of the every month. This makes changes in `batch table`. All the record are set to `0` for `has_changed` column, so that all applicants are once eligible for batch change in every month.
